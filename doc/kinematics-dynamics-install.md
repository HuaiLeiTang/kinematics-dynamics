# kinematics-dynamics: Installation from Source Code

First install the dependencies:

- [Install CMake 3.12+](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-cmake.md/)
- [Install YCM 0.11+](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-ycm.md/)
- [Install YARP 3.5+](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-yarp.md/)
- [Install KDL 1.4+](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-kdl.md/)

We optionally use the `ProximitySensorsClient` device from [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices) in the `haarDetectionController` app. Refer to its installation guide for instructions.

For unit testing, you'll need the googletest source package. Refer to [Install googletest](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-googletest.md/).

## Install kinematics-dynamics on Ubuntu (working on all tested versions)

Our software integrates the previous dependencies. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using `sudo` a couple of times:

```bash
cd  # go home
mkdir -p repos; cd repos  # create $HOME/repos if it does not exist; then, enter it
git clone https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics.git  # Download kinematics-dynamics software from the repository
cd kinematics-dynamics; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..  # Configure the kinematics-dynamics software
make -j$(nproc) # Compile
sudo make install; sudo ldconfig  # Install :-)
```

For CMake `find_package(ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS REQUIRED)`, you may also be interested in adding the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:
```bash
export ROBOTICSLAB_KINEMATICS_DYNAMICS_DIR=$HOME/repos/kinematics-dynamics/build  # Points to where TEOConfig.cmake is generated upon running CMake
```

For additional options use `ccmake` instead of `cmake`.

## Install Bindings

Swig is needed in order to build all language bindings. Refer to [Install SWIG](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-swig.md/).

### Install Python Bindings

First, install Python development packages.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libpython-dev  # not installed by default on clean distros
```

Make sure you have previously installed `kinematics-dynamics`.

```bash
cd  # go home
cd repos/kinematics-dynamics/bindings
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DCREATE_PYTHON=ON
make -j$(nproc)  # compile
sudo make install; sudo ldconfig; cd # install and go home
```

Note: You'll probably want [YARP Python bindings](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-yarp.md/#install-python-bindings) ([perma](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/33c93b68ab34a63157b1dc940dfb154a8504fff8/install-yarp.md#install-python-bindings)) too.

#### Install Python bindings (checking)

Check your installation via (should output nothing; if bad you will see a `ModuleNotFoundError`):

```bash
python -c "import kinematics_dynamics"
```

#### Install Python bindings (troubleshooting)

Extra care should be taken with Python 2 vs 3, and with Python paths in general. Toggle `t` in `ccmake ..` to see paths. `python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())"` is your friend, most probably the first element `python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])"` is good for you.

For many Python 3.x you may have to:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages/_kinematics_dynamics.so `python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])"`
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages/kinematics_dynamics.py `python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])"`
```

Specifically for Python 3.5m this will expand to:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages/_kinematics_dynamics.so /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/python3/dist-packages/kinematics_dynamics.py /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/
```

Done! You are now probably interested in one of the following links:
